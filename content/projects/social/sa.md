# The Blurb

After my misadventures as a student in the senior level robotics courses, for some reason, my professors thought it was a great idea to encourage other students with my bad ideas. So they made me an SA (like a TA minus the grading). Being an SA was one of the most rewarding experiences I had in college. I learned so much from my students, professors, and got really proficient with the course material. 

# Stuff I did
  - Installed Ubuntu on 60+ different laptops
  - Aided with lab and course design
  - Ran last minute panic sessions to teach material before tests
  - Developed and documented lab materials 
  - Got really good at debugging and understanding other peoples code quickly
  - Distributed 50 ducks to enforce the power of the rubber ducky method
