# The Blurb

[Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/) builds and automates warehouses. While moving big boxes sometimes their robots sometimes spill a variety of foods on the track and they needed away to clean it up. So they a cash prize and held a competition. WPI decided to put 5 freshman and one somophore on the project. My team and I won 2nd place and 25,000 dollars. 

# What I did
While I worked on every aspect of this project either building or helping my teammates, I did this thing and this thing too.

# Features
  - Large roller brush
  - EDF based vaccum  
  - Front mechanism is actuated up to avoid collisions
  - Water sprayers for particularly sticky messes
