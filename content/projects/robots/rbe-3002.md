# The Blurb

This project used a turtlebot burger to do SLAM around a maze. Most of the path planning and drive logic was developed from scratch using ROS. The robot first maps the field, then returns to its original position than can navigate to any point on the field using an input from rviz.

# What I did

# Features
  - A* path planning
  - RVIZ visualization
  - thanks to procrastination this class work was completed with 10 hours of cat videos and about 3.5 all nighters
