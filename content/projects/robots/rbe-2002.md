# The Blurb

Another robotics class means another robot. This robot was to be an autonomous “Fire Fighting” robot. The robot was tasked with navigating around the maze locating a “fire” (It was a candle), navigating back to the start and reporting the position of the fire.

# What I did
I worked on all parts of the robot spending most of my time on the mechanical design and electronics, and then about a week of sleepless nights in code. 

# Features
  - Entirely 3d printed robot 
  - 2 DOF mechanism to aim the sensor and fan 
  - Stackable Tower design for adding various layers
