# The Blurb

RBE 2001 was my second robotics class with another full robot as the semester project. This robot was designed to be a "Nuclear Power Plant" robot, tasked with moving rods of "nuclear fuel" around the field. The field communicated with the robot over Bluetooth and the robot autonomously navigated around the field. The robot was able to receive Emergency Stop, Resume and Restart commands as well. 

# What I did
I focused mainly on the Mechanical and Electrical design of the robot and also worked a little bit on some of the low level control.

# Features
  - Flexible Filament Gripper
  - Laser Cut Chassis
