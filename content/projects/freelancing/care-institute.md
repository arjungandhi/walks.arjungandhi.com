summary: identifying child care shortages with custom software
---

# The Blurb

In this freelancing project, I was hired to do data analysis and visualization to help identify shortages caused by COVID in child-care systems in the state of Massachusetts. For the first part of this project, I worked on visualizing census data for the state of massachusetts with the intention to visually compare population sizes against accessible childcare in Mass. counties. I built a custom webapp that used Leaflet.js and GeoJSON to dynamically visualize any field of census data. The client is currently working on retrieving corresponding information about childcare systems. 

# Features 
- Static webpage
- Cloud based
- Can visualize any piece of data by zip code across the US 
- Dynamically parses JSON so any data can be uploaded.
- Built in 6.75 hours
