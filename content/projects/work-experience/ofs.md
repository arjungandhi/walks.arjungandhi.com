# The Blurb

[OFS](https://www.ofsoptics.com/) (Optical Fiber Solutions) is a fiber manufacturing company. I've held two internships here (one in high school, and one the summer that I wrote this. My biggest project there was suggesting solutions and improvements to a fiber storage robot known as the ASRS. 

# Stuff I worked on
  - Evaluating the feasibility of computer vision based system to locate the position of the fiber racks
  - Designed and Proposed a ROS based replacement to the control systems of the robot! 
  - Printed some cool safety stickers
