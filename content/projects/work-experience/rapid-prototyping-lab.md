# The Blurb

This lab is WPI's 3D printing lab. There, I worked as a lab assistant managing over 40+ 3d printers, a laser cutter, and a PCB machine. I started working there at the start of the labs opening and spent a lot of time tuning all of the printers to get optimal performance.

# What I did
  - Educated Students on how to use the 3d printers and laser cutters
  - Helped with making designs more feasible for 3d printing
  - Managed the queue of prints from all the various students
  - Helped tune/repair 3d printers and the lase cutter
