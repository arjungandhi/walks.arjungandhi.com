I participated for more than a year as a staff-representative in a Discord server that was developed and moderated by a team of dedicated students, of which Arjun was one. This server, previously an underutilized resource, was reinvigorated by this team to help the WPI Robotics student population maintain a sense of community even in the face of the unexpected separation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Arjun was one of the primary moderators that I interacted with, and I had the pleasure of seeing firsthand the significant work he put into creating a positive, welcoming space in what can be a contentious online environment. This work ranged from active engagement with users to promote participation across multiple diverse topics and threads, to creating server-specific bots and emotes at user request and in response to the developing culture of the community, to working with myself, other staff, and faculty to ensure that the server was not only a social space, but a recreation of the kind of service and assistance students could find within the Robotics Engineering major. While the original moderation team all had a hand in creating this important, vibrant resource, I credit Arjun greatly with demonstrating and promoting on the server the spirit of inclusivity, humor, comradeship, and multidisciplinary excellence that exemplifies what it is to be a WPI Robotics Engineer.

  Simultaneously the stupidest and one of the smartest humans I've ever known.

  If Arjun asks you to join a project say yes.  And then get ready to keep up with the ensuing madness..

  Arjun is a great systems level thinker. To call Arjun a full stack engineer would be a disservice, because people use the term in the context of software engineering. Arjun is more, able to hack all the way from application code, to the bare metal electrical and mechanical engineering. If it requires critical thinking, it's a great fit and the rest will fall in to place for him.

  Arjun has this concept of "Apply \<Insert Person Here\>" when describing people that are so highly skilled they can be entrusted with any problem. All you have to do is give them the complicated issue to solve and some time later,  they'll return with a full solution and cause you zero headaches. You can tell these people love what they do, deriving their skills from their passion. 
  
  What Arjun fails to mention is that he is one of these people. He loves what he does and if there's a problem that he's passionate about, it'll get solved regardless of time or effort required. (The only caveat is there will be one or two headaches.)

We developed a computer application for urgent care medicine.  In order to bring it to the market, we needed a minimal viable product.  Arjun, in his last year at Worcester Polytechnic, looked over our material and developed a working website.  It had everything we wanted and is a vital asset to our Patented project. He was accurate, engaged, and innovative.  I respect his work and would support him for any job he would apply for.

Arjun is the person you call when you just can't figure out how to solve something, then he proposes simultaneously the wildest and most elegant solution to your problem you will ever hear.

Arjun was my student assistant in a high-level robotics course at our university. Whenever we run into a problem, he is always one of the most reliable people to consult. In short, he's a wizard from another dimension. 

Often, Arjun would stay up in the wee hours of the night/morning to help students debug their projects. He runs extra review/lecture sessions (with great skill) to ensure the success of the students in their courses. He is also incredible at emotional support whenever students have their souls crushed by the looming deadline of their robotics lab. Students could not have asked for a better student assistant, mentor, and role model. 

A single message won't do justice to Arjun's character. The only way to understand how grateful we are to him is to join his fun.
