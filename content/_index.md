I'm Arjun. I look like this:

{{< google-photos MD7BwFZTrSR9Z12L6 carousel 40 >}}

I make robots, and write software. 

This site is where I dump info about stuff I've done, posts vary from straight pictures to my life story.

If you're short on time hit the toggle switch on the top of the long posts to turn on TLDR mode.

## hire me! 

I work on a variety of projects from scalable cloud infrastructure to high DOF robots. I love hard problems and I love to work with people. If you have a project you'd like to hire me for shoot me an [email](/contact)

## work with me! 

I love fun hobby projects too!. If you're interested in one [contact me](/contact). I love helping out and learning about other peoples projects, so let me know if you're doing something cool and need some help! 

## freetime 

Outside of robots I like to boulder, swim, and going on 3 am adventures to random beaches.
